\section{Opportunities with low $A$}

The primary challenge of modeling QCD effects within nuclei is to overcome
the strong coupling in a many body system.  Presently, even the most advanced
techniques are only able to approach descriptions of nuclei with $A \le 4$, 
which is below where one may expect bulk modification effect to occur.  However,
to ultimately obtain a full description, advancement in models and comparison
to few-body nuclear data are critical.  In addition, the formalism of generalized
parton distributions can be extended to nuclei,  offering a new window of 
exploration unifying the study of the modification of partons and form factors
and an opportunity to provide a tomographic map of nuclei.
