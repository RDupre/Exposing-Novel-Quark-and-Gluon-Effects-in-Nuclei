\section{GPDs of He nuclei}

It is clear since many years that inclusive measurements alone cannot
provide a 
full quantitative explanation of the EMC
effect \cite{Aubert:1983xm}.
Imaging of nuclei, possible now for the first time
through DVCS and DVMP, using the tool of GPDs, can
answer the question \cite{Dupre:2015jha}. Indeed,
a pictorial representation of the realization of the
EMC effect will be at hand, through the comparison of 
quark and gluon distributions 
in nuclei, in the transverse plane, to be obtained in coherent DVCS, or 
in bound nucleons, extracted from incoherent DVCS, with the corresponding
quantities measured for free nucleons.
The presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom, 
as addressed in Ref. \cite{primo},
or the 
change of confinement radii in bound nucleons, will be oserved.

The valence region at intermediate $Q^2$, investigated by 
JLab at 12 GeV, is crucial to access
the most discussed region of the EMC effect.
For light nuclei, such as $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He,
although sometimes challenging, a realistic evaluation of 
conventional nuclear effects is possible.
This would allow to distinguish them
from exotic ones, which could be responsible of
the observed EMC behaviour. Without realistic benchmark calculations,  
the interpretation of the collected data will be hardly conclusive. 
$^2$H is very interesting, for its rich spin structure
and for the extraction of the neutron information;
$^4$He, scalar and isoscalar, as deeply bound 
as a finite nucleus, is ideal to start with.
In between these two targets, $^3$He could allow
to study the $A$ dependence of nuclear effects and
it could give an easy access to neutron polarization properties,
due to its specific spin structure. Besides, being not isoscalar, 
flavor dependence of nuclear effects could be studied, 
in particular if parallel measurements 
on $^3$H targets were possible \cite{Scopetta:2009sn}.
Due to the very small cross sections,
especially in the coherent channel where the nucleus does not break-up,
the addressed measurements are very difficult.
Despite of this, the first data for coherent DVCS off $^4$He,
collected at JLab, with the 6 GeV electron beam,
have been published \cite{Hattawy:2017woc}.
A new impressive program is on the way at JLab12,
carried on by the ALERT collaboration 
\cite{Armstrong:2017wfw,Armstrong:2017zcm,Armstrong:2017zqr}.
Measurements for $^3$He and $^3$H
are not planned but could be considered
for the upgrade of the ALERT project, at least in the unpolarized 
sector. Polarized measurements, although extremely interesting
to access the neutron angular momentum information \cite{Rinaldi:2012pj,
Rinaldi:2012ft,Rinaldi:2014bba}, seem
very unlikely at JLab12, due to the difficulty of arranging
a polarized target and a recoil detector very close to each other. 

From the theoretical point of view, a realistic calculation 
of conventional effects for
nuclear few-body systems corresponds to a plane wave impulse approximation 
(IA) analysis. This requires the evaluation of realistic non-diagonal spectral
function for $^3$He and $^4$He.
For the first target a complete analysis using the Argonne 18 (Av18)
nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential is available
\cite{Scopetta:2004kj,Scopetta:2009sn,Rinaldi:2012pj,
Rinaldi:2012ft,Rinaldi:2014bba}.
Nuclear GPDs are found to be sensitive to details on 
the used NN interaction.
A study with nuclear ingredients of the same quality
for $^4$He is still missing and should be performed, to update 
existing calculations \cite{Guzey:2003jh,Liuti:2005gi}. 
The evaluation of a realistic spectral functions of $^4$He,
using state-of-the-art NN potentials,
will require the wave function of a three-body scattering state, 
a really challenging problem.
Besides, in the incoherent channel of DVCS off $^2$H, $^3$He, $^4$He,
even the study of specific final state interactions will be necessary,
another cumbersome task. 

An encouraging approximated calculation has been recently
performed for coherent DVCS off $^4$He \cite{sara}, with the aim to
describe the CLAS data, as an intermediate
step towards a realistic evaluation.
A model of the nuclear non diagonal spectral function, 
based on the momentum distribution
corresponding to the Av18 NN interaction
\cite{vivia}, has been used in the 
actual IA
calculation. Typical results
are found, in proper limits, for the nuclear form factor
and for nuclear parton distributions.
Nuclear GPDs and the
Compton form factor are evaluated using, as nucleonic ingredient,
a well known GPD model \cite{gk}. 
As it can be seen in Fig. \ref{alu}, a very good agreement 
is found with the data.  
One can conclude that 
a careful analysis of the reaction mechanism in terms of
basic conventional ingredients is succesful and that
the present experimental accuracy does not require
the use of exotic arguments, such as dynamical off shellness.
More refined nuclear calculations will be certainly necessary for 
the expected improved accuracy of the next generation of experiments 
at JLab, with the 12 GeV electron beam and high luminosity. 
  
While JLab will provide important information
in the valence region, the extension to lower
x values will be possible only at the EIC \cite{Accardi:2012qut}. 
Great opportunities at the EIC are also those related to the possibility
of easily using $^3$H beams, or polarized trinucleons beams and 
recoil detectors at the same time, to access, for example, 
the neutron polarized structure and the flavor dependence 
of nuclear effects.
