\section{Summary - Recommendations}

The challenge for the next era of understanding medium modification is clear and the path to answer to key questions is open. 
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the isovector nature of the EMC effect?  This requires a set of high-precision experiments across nuclei of traditional inclusive cross section ratios, electroweak measurements which are sensitive to unique quark flavor combinations, and Drell-Yan experiments.  These would be complemented by exclusive isotope tagging experiments. 
\item What is the spin dependence of the EMC effect?  There is no experimental information available and any such measurement would break into new ground and would provide new information on potential mechanisms.
\item What is the transverse momentum depedence of the EMC effect?  This can be addressed through tagged scattering measurements which can separate local density and mean field mechanisms.   

\item What is the Full Nucleus Image (in terms of quarks and gluons), deuteron specifically, potential EIC details
\end{itemize}

We are grateful to the ECT* for hosting the workshop which made this work possible.
